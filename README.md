# tbh

tbh is (going to be) a functional programming language that compiles to Javascript and, where possible, to WebAssembly. Its aim is for me to learn more about compilers.

tbh, the language gets inspiration from Imba, Ruby, Elixir, and Python, but its goal is not to be the language with the best syntax out there (I am going to implement features that I think would be cool to implement).

For examples, see `examples/`. For an overview of features, see `DOCUMENTATION.md`. For the technical description of the syntax, typing rules, and optimizations, see `SPEC.md`.
